1. Improve Security with Key Fingerprinting
   Problem: Right now, you're vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. An attacker could intercept the initial connection, perform a key exchange with both you and your peer, and then sit in the middle, decrypting and re-encrypting all your traffic.

Suggestion: Implement key fingerprinting. After the key exchange, calculate a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the peer's public key and display it. You and your peer would then verify this short string of characters through a separate, trusted channel (like a phone call or text message). If the fingerprints match, you can be confident you're connected directly to each other. This is often called "Trust On First Use" (TOFU).

2. Enhance the User Interface (UI)
   Timestamps: Add a timestamp to each message (e.g., [20:45] You: Hello). This makes conversations much easier to follow.

Clearer Status Bar: The status bar could be more dynamic. Instead of just a static message, it could show the current state (e.g., CONNECTING, CONNECTED to 1.2.3.4, TRANSFERRING FILE).

Help View: Add a keybinding (like ?) that opens a small popup or changes the view to show available commands (/send, /quit, etc.) and keybindings.

3. Add More Robust Functionality
   File Transfer Cancellation: What if you start sending a huge file by mistake? Add a command (e.g., /cancel) or a keybinding (like Ctrl+C during a transfer) that sends a special "cancel" message to the peer to stop the transfer.

Connection Resilience: If the network connection briefly drops, the app currently quits. You could implement a mechanism to automatically try and reconnect to the peer for a certain period before giving up.

Directory Transfers: Extend the /send command to handle directories. The simplest way would be to automatically zip the directory on the sender's side, transfer the single .zip file, and have the receiver unzip it.
